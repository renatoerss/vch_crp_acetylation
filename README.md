# vch_crp_acetylation

Reproducible analysis workflows supporting the study of CRP K52 acetylation in *Vibrio cholerae*.  
This repository includes annotated Google Colab notebooks with mock datasets demonstrating key analyses used in the manuscript, such as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and growth-curve experiments.  
Each notebook includes a description of its purpose, expected inputs (with example files), and representative outputs.

## Repository structure
- `notebooks/` – Google Colab notebooks  
- `data_example/` – minimal mock datasets for demonstration  
- `docs/` – metadata and supplementary documentation  

## How to use
Each notebook can be opened directly in Google Colab.  
Mock datasets allow execution without access to experimental data.
